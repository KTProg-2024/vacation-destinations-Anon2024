        <p> Norway is a european country that is on the northern side of the european continent.<br>It is so up north in fact that in some parts of Norway, you could see the northern lights.<br>One of the main selling points for why people would want to come here is to see the massive mountain ranges and take pictures.<br>I mean LOOK AT THEM!</p>
