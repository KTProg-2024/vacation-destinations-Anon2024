        <p>Florida is a hot and humid state on the southern side of the USA.<br> It is a famous vacation spot because there are many things to do in it.<br>There are the 2 attractions I said already like Disney world and Legoland. They also have many beaches.<br>If you're not in the mood for theme parks and want to see nature, Flrida also is home to the Everglades National park.<br>I could keep going on and on about the things you could do in Florida but I'm going to leave that to you. It's YOUR trip.</p>

        <p>If you wanted to catch a Flight from Boston to Florida, for one adult it would cost $70 dollars and about 3 hours and 25 minutes to fly to Miami.<br>But chances are that you are going with more than just yourself.<br>If you are going with your family of 3 poeple, you, your wife/husband, and a kid, it would cost $210 dollars to fly to Miami.<br>And Miami is the cheapest destination to fly to.</p>
